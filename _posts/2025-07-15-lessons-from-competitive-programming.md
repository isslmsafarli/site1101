    <h1>Lessons from Competitive Programming</h1>
    <p>
      Competitive programming and informatics olympiads trained me to think clearly under time pressure.
      You have to understand a problem fast, design a solution, and implement it with almost zero tolerance
      for bugs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The biggest lessons for me were about patterns: recognizing when a problem is actually about graphs,
      dynamic programming, greedy strategies, or data structures. Once you see the pattern, the solution
      space becomes much smaller.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond the contests, these skills transfer directly into software and startups: breaking problems
      into smaller pieces, testing ideas quickly, and staying calm when something breaks five minutes
      before a deadline.
