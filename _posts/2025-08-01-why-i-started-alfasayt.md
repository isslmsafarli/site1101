    <h1>Why I Started Alfasayt</h1>
    <p>
      Alfasayt Digital Solutions started from a simple observation: many small and medium businesses
      in Azerbaijan needed a modern website, but most agencies were either too expensive or too slow.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wanted to build a service that was fast, affordable, and execution-focused. Instead of endless
      meetings and documents, the goal was to ship real websites, learn from clients, and improve
      with each project. In the first few months we delivered more than twenty websites, which gave me
      a clearer picture of how traditional businesses actually work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfasayt is still early, but it is my personal lab for learning sales, delivery, systems,
      and how to grow a real business from zero.
