    <h1>Building e-Zəmanət: From Idea to MVP</h1>
    <p>
      e-Zəmanət was born from a very practical problem: paper warranties are easy to lose, hard to track,
      and painful for both customers and companies. We wanted to make the whole process digital, secure,
      and simple.

    <p>
      The first phase was about understanding real workflows in electronics shops and service centers.
      Only after mapping those flows did we start designing the system, database, and user journeys.
      The MVP focused on the smallest useful feature set: registering products, attaching warranties,
      and verifying them quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The project is still evolving, but even this early version has taught me a lot about
      product discovery, working with partners, and building software that has to work in the real world,
      not just in a demo.
